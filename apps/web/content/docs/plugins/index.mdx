# Plugins

Plugins extend Structure Creator by processing file content during structure creation. They're JavaScript modules that can transform, augment, or validate file content before it's written to disk.

## Use Cases

- **License Headers**: Automatically add copyright notices to source files
- **Content Transformation**: Convert content formats or apply formatting rules
- **Template Injection**: Insert timestamps, author info, or project metadata
- **Code Standards**: Enforce coding conventions or add boilerplate

## How Plugins Work

When you create a project structure, plugins run in the frontend before files are sent to the backend for writing:

1. Structure Creator parses your schema
2. For each file, matching plugins are found by file extension
3. Plugins process file content sequentially (by load order)
4. The processed content is written to disk

Plugins only process **text files**. Binary files (images, databases) and files with `generate` attributes are not processed.

## Plugin Manager

Access the Plugin Manager from the sidebar to manage your installed plugins.

### Installing Plugins

1. Click **Install Plugin** in the Plugin Manager
2. Select a folder containing a valid plugin (must have `plugin.json` and `index.js`)
3. The plugin is copied to your plugins directory and registered

### Enabling/Disabling Plugins

Toggle the switch next to any plugin to enable or disable it. Disabled plugins won't process files during structure creation.

### Uninstalling Plugins

Click the trash icon next to a plugin to remove it from your system.

## Plugin Directory

Plugins are stored in:

```
~/.structure-creator/plugins/
```

Each plugin lives in its own subdirectory:

```
~/.structure-creator/plugins/
├── license-header/
│   ├── plugin.json
│   └── index.js
└── timestamp-plugin/
    ├── plugin.json
    └── index.js
```

## Security Warning

Plugins run with **full application permissions** in the frontend context. Only install plugins from trusted sources. A malicious plugin could:

- Read or modify file content
- Access environment variables passed to the app
- Make network requests

Review plugin code before installation, especially the `index.js` file.
