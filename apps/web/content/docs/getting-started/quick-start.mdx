# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through creating your first folder structure with Structure Creator.

## Step 1: Define Your Schema

You have three ways to define a schema:

1. **Write XML** - Use the XML editor in the center panel
2. **Import a folder** - Scan an existing folder to generate a schema
3. **Import a ZIP file** - Use a zip archive as your schema source

For this guide, we'll write XML. Click the **XML** tab in the center panel and enter this schema:

```xml
<folder name="%PROJECT_NAME%">
  <folder name="src">
    <file name="index.ts" />
  </folder>
  <file name="package.json">
{
  "name": "%PROJECT_NAME:kebab-case%",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
  </file>
  <file name="README.md">
# %PROJECT_NAME%

A new project.
  </file>
</folder>
```

## Step 2: Set Variables

In the Variables section on the right panel:

1. Find the `PROJECT_NAME` variable that was detected
2. Enter a value like `My New Project`

## Step 3: Preview

Switch to the **Preview** tab in the center panel to see a tree view of what will be created:

```
My New Project/
├── src/
│   └── index.ts
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Step 4: Choose Output Location

1. Click **Browse** next to the output path
2. Select where you want to create the structure (e.g., `~/Projects`)

## Step 5: Create Structure

Click **Create Structure** to generate the files and folders.

The log panel will show:
- ✓ Created folder: My New Project
- ✓ Created folder: My New Project/src
- ✓ Created file: My New Project/src/index.ts
- ✓ Created file: My New Project/package.json
- ✓ Created file: My New Project/README.md
